# Hotel Booking System

The project aims to develop a hotel reservation system. This system is designed to meet the needs of users for searching hotels,
making reservations, and managing their bookings. Additionally, it provides hotel administrators with the capability to monitor
hotel capacities and send alerts for hotels with low occupancy. The system also includes a notification service to process
new bookings and send notifications to users regarding their reservation details. In this way, users can easily plan their
vacations, while hotel administrators can efficiently manage hotel capacities.
